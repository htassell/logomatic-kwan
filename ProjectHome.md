Logomatic Kwan - Alternate firmware for the [Sparkfun Logomatic](http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=8627) based upon the NXP LPC2148 microcontroller.

The primary improvement over the old Logomatic code is that it can record serial and analog data at the same time. Secondary improvements include oversampling and GPS synchronization.
